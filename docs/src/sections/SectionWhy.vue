    <h2>Why not...</h2>
    <p>
      There are loads of Animation libraries available for JavaScript and each
      has its place. AutoAnimate is not a traditional animation library — think
      of it more as "Prettier for motion" — it is an easy to implement,
      standardized, and generally tasteful.

    <p>
      AutoAnimate helps smooth out changes to the DOM that that are confusing
      for end users. For example, when a user sorts a list it can be very
      difficult to visualize how the items in the list move — but with a simple
      animation it makes intuitive sense. AutoAnimate was made to solve these
      kinds of problems via a drop-in solution with zero config.
