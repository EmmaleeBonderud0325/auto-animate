    <h2>Why not...?</h2>
    <p>
      There are loads of Animation libraries available for JavaScript and each
      has its place. AutoAnimate is not a traditional animation library — think
      of it more as "Prettier for motion" — it is an easy-to-implement standard
      you can quickly apply to any project.

      AutoAnimate’s goal is to smooth out changes to the DOM that are otherwise
      confusing to end-users. For example, when a user sorts a list with no
      animations it is difficult to visualize how the items in the list have
      actually changed — but with AutoAnimate the changes suddenly make
      intuitive sense. AutoAnimate was made to solve this category of problem
      via a drop-in solution with zero-config.
